1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Aerospike Enterprise Features Key**

Copy the full text of the feature key you received from Aerospike

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click **Aerospike OnDemand Plan Small**.
    1. Perform the following steps to configure the VM settings for the Aerospike cluster for the **Small** plan.
        1. For **VM type for the Aerospike Cluster**, use the dropdown menu to select the VM type to use for each Aerospike node. The dropdown menu is automatically populated with the list of VMs configured for your cloud environment.
        1. For **Disk type for Aerospike Cluster VMs**, use the dropdown menu to select the disk type to use for each Aerospike node.
        1. For **Number of instances for the Aerospike Cluster**, enter the number of instances to use for the **Small** plan. This is your cluster size.
        1. Under **Availability zone(s) for Plan 'Small'**, select one or more checkboxes that correspond to the availability zone(s) where this service will be deployed.

<!-- 1. Perform the following steps to configure the namespace for the **Small** plan.
    <br><%= image_tag('plan-config-2.png') %>
    1. For **Name of the namespace**, enter the name of the namespace that will be created in the Aerospike service for the **Small** plan.
    1. For **Storage device for namespace**, use the dropdown menu to select the storage device that the namespace will use. A **Device** storage type persists the data, and a **Memory** storage type does not.
    1. For **Default ttl for namespace**, enter the default time-to-live for records that will be stored in the Aerospike service. Records will expire in the system beyond this time. A value of **0** means that records will never expire. This default value can be overriden by the client if desired.
    1. For **Size of namespace**, enter the size of the namespace. This is the maximum amount of memory to allocate for records that will be maintained in this Aerospike service.
    1. For **Replication factor for namespace**, use the dropdown menu to select the replication factor to use for the **Small** plan. The replication factor is the number of copies of the record to maintain within the cluster.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The replication factor is limited to the number of nodes in the cluster.</p>
    1. For **File size for namespace**, enter the file size to use for the namespace. Only complete this field if the namespace is using the **Device** storage type. Pivotal recommends using a file size that is roughly 4x the size of the namespace.
    1. Select the **Keep a copy of namespace always in memory** checkbox to instruct the Aerospike service to always keep a copy of all records in memory. Only complete this field if the namespace is using the **Device** storage type. For a **Memory** storage type, all records are always in memory. -->

1. Click **Save**.

1. Configure the **Medium** and **Large** plans following the same steps as above.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the Aerospike EE OnDemand Service for PCF tile.
