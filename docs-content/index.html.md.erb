<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING:</strong>

This documentation describes Aerospike EE OnDemand Service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). Aerospike EE OnDemand Service for PCF allows you to configure and deploy multiple Aerospike Enterprise Edition NoSQL database clusters to your PCF deployment. 

These clusters can be configured and scaled independently as required by your app. The tile allows you to configure the default settings for small, medium, and large cluster plans. Developers can create instances of these service plans using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to apps to access the Aerospike database managed by this service.

Once created, Aerospike clusters can be modified using the cf CLI. This allows dynamic scaling of the services as required.

* Create and destroy Aerospike database cluster services as required using the cf CLI
